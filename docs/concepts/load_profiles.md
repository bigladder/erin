# Load Profiles

A load profile represents a sequence of load items.
A load item expresses a given rate (i.e., the load) and its duration.

Subsequences of a Load_profile can be chosen.
Similarly, Load_profiles can be scaled.
The times of events for a Load_profile can be obtained by giving a starting time and accumulating the Load_item durations.
