# Networks

# array of 2, 4, or 6 element tuples each array holds a connection.
# 2-tuple:
# ["A","B"] is short-hand for: ["A","outflow",0,"B","inflow",0] where "A" is
# the id for the first component and "B" is the id for the second component.
# "Outflow" indicates the port type (inflow or outflow). Inflow and Outflow are
# determined per the "normal flow direction". The "0" values indicate the port
# number for the case of components with multiple ports; port numbering starts
# at 0. Thus, this connects the first "outflow" port of "A" to the first
# "inflow" port of "B".
# 4-tuple:
# ["A", "outflow", "B", "inflow"] maps to:
# ["A", "outflow", "0", "B", "inflow", "0"]
# 6-tuple: (full specification)
# ["A", "outflow", "1", "B", "inflow", "0"] would indicate that A's second outflow
# port (ports are numbered from 0) is connected to B's first inflow port.
# Note: due to limitations in TOML's C++ parsing library, all elements of an
# array must be of the same type so we quote integer port ids
