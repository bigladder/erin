# Modelkit/Params Template for Running E2RIN

This mini-project allows one to use template composition to generate an input file for E2RIN.

We assume that you have `modelkit` installed.
Once installed, from within this directory, you can call compose as follows:

> modelkit template-compose --output="test.toml" --files="ex.pxt" "template.toml"
